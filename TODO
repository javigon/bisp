* Fix /bif/simu_main.py
  =====================
  
  Currently this is totally broken.

* Fix imports
  ===========
  
  Imports are currently a mess.
  
  Proposal 1:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~
  - We agree on a root, say /
  - Every file not located at the root makes sure that sys.path contains a reference to it.
  - All imports can then be made with a single point of origin
  - Pros:
    - A simple solution
    - Test code can be placed in dedicated directories
    - No environment variables needs to be set

* Fix indents
  ===========
  
  We have agreed on 4 spaces.
  
  Currently this is applied for everything except /sim.
  
  We need an automated approach to fix it. I dare no do so by hand.
